# Vaibhav Sharma | Portfolio

A personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a UX Researcher and Designer. Built with a focus on immersive interactions, clean aesthetic, and performance.

## 🚀 Overview

This project serves as a digital home for my case studies, experiments, and professional journey. It bridges the gap between design and development, featuring custom React components, complex animations, and a polished user experience.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Interactive Work Carousel:** A custom 3D horizontal scroll experience for browsing projects.
- **Scrollytelling Philosophy:** A "Bridge" section that reveals my design philosophy word-by-word as you scroll.
- **Bento Grid Toolkit:** A responsive, interactive grid showcasing my skills and tools.
- **Deep Dive Case Studies:** Detailed project pages (e.g., BrewQuest) with custom layouts and data visualizations.
